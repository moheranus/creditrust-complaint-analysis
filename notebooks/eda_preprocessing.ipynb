    "The CFPB dataset (~6 GB, 9,609,797 rows) was analyzed to understand complaint distribution and narrative characteristics. It contains complaints across various products, with 2,980,756 (~31%) having narratives. The top products include Credit Card (226,686), Consumer Loan (31,574), Payday loan/BNPL (16,514), Bank account or service (86,205), and Money transfer/virtual currency (145,066), as visualized in a bar plot (`data/eda_plots/product_distribution.png`). Narrative lengths range from 0 to 6,469 words (mean: ~54, median: 0 due to missing narratives), shown in a histogram (`data/eda_plots/narrative_length_distribution.png`), indicating the need for chunking in Task 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was filtered to include only Credit Card, Personal Loan, BNPL, Savings Account, and Money Transfer complaints with non-empty narratives, resulting in 211,097 records (470.99 MB). Text was cleaned by lowercasing, removing special characters, and normalizing whitespace to improve embedding quality. The cleaned dataset was saved as `data/filtered_complaints.csv` (or `C:/temp/filtered_complaints.csv` if permissions failed) and will be shared via a cloud link due to GitHub's 100 MB file size limit.\n",
